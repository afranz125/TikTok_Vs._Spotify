# TikTok_Vs._Spotify
Analyze a dataset on kaggle that inlcudes information on songs/tracks (100 per year) from Top Hit playlists from 2010 to 2022 created by Spotify. We can evaluate each song by features such as danceability, energy, loudness, mode, tempo, etc. I would like to see how these features change year to year.
